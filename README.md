# Python basics

In this exercise, you are going to learn how to get python to output numbers and text.  You are also going to learn how Python can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions.  Start by typing: 

````
print("Hello World!")
````

In the box on the top left.  When you have done so, click the 'run' button at the top. 

When you run this code you should find the phrase "Hello World!" is output in the black box on the bottom right.

Lets now use Python as a calculator.  Python is an improvement on your calculator as when you do your calculations with Python you can see what formula was evaluated as well as the answer.  It should, therefore, be easier to detect your mistakes.  Try doing the following calculation using python:

````
print ( 7/ 1+6 )
````

Now try this one:

````
print ( 7/(1+6) )
````

Why is the value printed here different to the value you got from the previous exercise?

Now try these two calculations:

````
print ( 10 / 10**2 )
print ( (10/10)**2 )
````

Given these the results from these calculations (and the results from other experiments you might try)what order does Python use when evaluating the addition, exponent and multiplication operators in an expression.  Write a program that prints this order to screen.  If you think, for instance, that Python does addition, then takes exponents and then multiplication you should write:

````
print("addition")
print("exponents")
print("multiplication")
````
